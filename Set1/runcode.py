#I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell 
#A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell 
#In ecstasy in the back of me 
#Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's 
#Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy 
#Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy. 
#
#I'm lettin' my drug kick in 
#It controls my mouth and I begin 
#To just let it flow, let my concepts go 
#My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go! 
#
#Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be 
#And if you don't give a damn, then 
#Why you starin' at me 
#So get off 'cause I control the stage 
#There's no dissin' allowed 
#I'm in my own phase 
#The girlies sa y they love me and that is ok 
#And I can dance better than any kid n' play 
#
#Stage 2 -- Yea the one ya' wanna listen to 
#It's off my head so let the beat play through 
#So I can funk it up and make it sound good 
#1-2-3 Yo -- Knock on some wood 
#For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious 
#Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious 
#I'm an effect and that you can bet 
#I can take a fly girl and make her wet. 
#
#I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah 
#There's no denyin', You can try to hang 
#But you'll keep tryin' to get my style 
#Over and over, practice makes perfect 
#But not if you're a loafer. 
#
#You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls 
#Soon -- Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat 
#Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it! 
#
#VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino 
#Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino 
#So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin' 
#Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin' 
#'Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue 
#Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along 
#All through the ghetto groovin' this here song 
#Now you're amazed by the VIP posse. 
#
#Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi 
#Startled by the bases hittin' ground 
#There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down 
#Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic 
#You trapped me once and I thought that 
#You might have it 
#So step down and lend me your ear 
#'89 in my time! You, '90 is my year. 
#
#You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it 
#Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it 
#So don't be mad and don't be sad 
#'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad 
#You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure 
#Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure 
#So come up close and don't be square 
#You wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere 
#
#You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong 
#So come on, everybody and sing this song 
#
#Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go 
#play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go 
#Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die. 
#
#Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear 
#Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it 
#Play that funky music A little louder now 
#Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on 
#Play that funky music
